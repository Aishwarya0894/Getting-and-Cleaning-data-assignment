Provides instructions on how to run_analysis.R file on Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset used: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files:
1. "CodeBook.md" a code book that describes the variables and any transformations performed 
2. "run_analysis.R" contains the code to performs the data preparation 

Steps required for data cleaning and transformation:
1. Download and unzip the file
2. Read the test and train data
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
4. Extracts only the columns containing mean and standard deviation using feature file
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set using activity_label file
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
7. Create another dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and  subject
